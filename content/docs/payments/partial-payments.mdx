# Partial Payments

Accept partial payments on your platform.

<Divider className='max-w-100  mb-2' />


## Introduction

With this feature, if you attempt to charge someone USD 100 but they only pay USD 90, the
transaction will be put on hold and tagged <code> incomplete </code>. until the person completes the
payment. With partial debits, we will not hold the <code>amount_paid </code> instead we will forward it to you
(the business) and send you a webhook for the transaction althought itâ€™ll still have a status of 
 <code> incomplete </code>

<Divider className='max-w-100  mb-12' />

## How Does it Work?

You can use the partial payment feature through our accept payment api or through our checkout and Libraries

 <Alert 
    status="info" 
    className="mt-8 mb-2 " 
   content=' When using the partial payment feature, you need to pass the parameter "accept_partial_payment" : 
   true'/>

<Divider className='max-w-100  mb-14' />

## Verifying Transactions
When verifying transactions (or implementing webhooks) that involve Partial Payments, there are
two types of amounts that are returned: <code>actualAmount</code> and <code> actualPaid;</code>.<code> actualPaid</code> is the
amount (in crypto) that the customer paid while <code>actualAmount</code> is the amount (in crypto) you
intend to charge.

<Alert 
    status="info" 
    className="mt-8 mb-8 " 
   content='The fiat equivalent for the types of amounts are called fiatAmount and amountPaidFiat'/>
