## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for you to subscribe to events that occur when an event involving your 
business occurs. This guide will walk through what webhooks are and how you can use them in
 order to get started with integrating them into your application.

A webhook URL is an endpoint on your server where you can receive notifications about such
 events. When an event occurs, we'll make a POST request to that endpoint, with a JSON body
  containing the details about the event, including the type of event and the data associated with it.


<Alert
status='info'
className='my-7'
content='Rather than continuously polling the server to check if the state has changed, webhooks provide 
information to you as it becomes available, which is a lot more efficient and beneficial for developers.'
/>


Here are some sample webhook paylods for deposit transactions

<CodeBlock req1='' id1='webHookPayload' lang='json' className='h-[492px] ' />

## Enabling WebHooks

## Validating WebHook Signature

Every webhook event payload will contain a hashed authentication signature in the header which 
is computed by generating a hash from concatenating your API key and request body,
using the HMAC SHA256 hash algorithm.

In order to verify this signature came from Lazerpay, you simply have to generate the HMAC 
SHA256 hash and compare it with the signature received.

<CodeBlock req1='' id1='webHookPayload2' lang='js' />

## Responding to WebHooks Request

You must respond with a <code>200 ok</code> status code. Any other response code outside of the <code>2xx</code>
range, will be considered as a failure, including <code>3xx</code> codes. <b>We don't 
care about the response body or header</b>

<Alert
status='info'
content="If we don't get a 200 OK status code, we will retry the webhook every one minute for the next 24hrs"
/>
