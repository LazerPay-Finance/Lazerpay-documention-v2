# Partial Payments
 Accept partail payments on your platform

 ## Introduction

 With this feature if you attempt to charge someone $100 but the decide to pay $90, the 
 transaction will be put on hold and tagged <code>incomplete</code> until the person completes the 
 payments. With partial debits we will not hold the <code>amount paid</code>, instead we will forward it to you
 (the business) and send a webhook for the transaction, although it'll still have a status of 
 <code>incomplete</code>

## How Does it Work?

You can use the partial payments feature through our <code>accept payment API</code> or through our <code>checkout</code>
and <code>libraries</code>
