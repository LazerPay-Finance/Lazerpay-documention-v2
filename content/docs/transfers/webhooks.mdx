## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks are a way for you to subscribe to events that occur when an event involving your 
business occurs. This guide will walk through what webhooks are and how you can use them in
 order to get started with integrating them into your application.

A webhook URL is an endpoint on your server where you can receive notifications about such
 events. When an event occurs, we'll make a POST request to that endpoint, with a JSON body
  containing the details about the event, including the type of event and the data associated with it.

content='Rather than continuously polling the server to check if the state has changed, webhooks provide 
information to you as it becomes available, which is a lot more efficient and beneficial for developers.'
