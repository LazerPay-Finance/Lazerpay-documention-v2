## Lazerpayâ€™s Node JS SDK

The SDK allows you to initialise a payment transaction and to confirm payment. It's an NPM 
package so you can use it in a node environment.

Here's a sample code on how to use the NodeJS SDK:

<CodeBlock options req1='Hide Response' id1='nodeJsSdkSample'/>

<CodeBlock options req1='Response JSON' id1='nodeJsSdkSampleResponse' className='!bg-white code-war-500' lang='json'/>


When a payment is successful, Lazerpay sends a <code>DEPOSIT_TRANSACTION</code> When a payment is successful, Lazerpay sends a
webhook URL that you provide. It is highly recommended that you use webhooks to confirm the 
payment status before delivering value to your customers.
