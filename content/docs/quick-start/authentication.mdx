# Authentication

Authenticate your API calls by including your secret key or public key depending on 
the request you're making in the header of request you make.

Generally, we provide both public and secret keys. Public keys are meant to be used from your front-
end when integrating Lazerpay Inline Checkout and our Frontend libraries. By design, public keys cannot modify any part of your account besides initiating transactions. The secret keys however, are to be kept secret. If for any reason you believe your secret key has been compromised or you wish to reset them, you can do so from the dashboard.

Authorization headers should be in the following format:

<code>Authorization: Bearer SECRET_KEY</code> <code>X-ap-key: PUBLIC_KEY</code>

    API requests must be made over HTTPS.
