This is the repository for the Lazerpay documentation site
[docs.lazerpay.finance][wi]. Lazerpay Documentation accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some contributing guidelines,
contact points, and other resources to make it easier to contribute to
lazerpay-documentation-v2.

If you've run into a problem or have a suggestion, browse the open [issues][is]
before opening a new one. We use the following [label system][la] to organize
our issues.

- ![][cr] for typos, broken links, and other quick fixes
- ![][tr] for additions to the FAQ and Troubleshooting sections
- ![][im] for revisions, rewrites, and larger improvements
- ![][fe] for feedback on structure & content
- ![][qu] for questions that can't be answered via documentation
- ![][fi] for improvements and fixups related to the look and feel of the docs
  site

### Best practices for managing contributions

- If a question is asked more than twice in the documentation channel, it should be
  added as an outstanding ![][tr] issue. If a resolution is found, it should be
  captured in the issue before it's closed or in a following pull request.
  Those involved in the support process should contribute to the documentation
  (i.e. if you answered the question, be sure to capture the outcome in the
  relevant documentation).

- If a piece of unaddressed feedback is given more than three times, a ![][fe]
  issue should be created and added to the [Feedback Hub][fh] to be prioritized
  in the following weekly sync.

- Issues will be reviewed on a rolling basis and triaged weekly by
  [@MeisterJustice](https://github.com/MeisterJustice) and [@Frontend-io](https://github.com/Frontend-io)

# How to Contribute

- [Get Started](#get-started)
- [Editing Content](#editing-content)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

## Get Started

- Create a fork of the documentation, install neccessary dependencies by running `yarn`
- To start your server, run `yarn dev` and you'll have your development server running on **localhost:3000**

## Editing Content
To add a new content, e.g page, please note this is a NextJS app, a knowledge of NextJS is required to work with files and how pages are routed. 

- All new pages should go to the `content/docs` folder accordingly. The pages are written in markdown (MDX - an extension of MD). 
- MDX allows you to use JSX components in the same file. If you have a section of the page that is written in JSX, please create that component and include it to the existing [mdx-component object](https://github.com/LazerPay-Finance/Lazerpay-documentation-v2/blob/main/components/mdx-components.tsx) so it is properly mapped when rendering. Don't forget to export the component in the entry `index.ts` file before importing anywhere else.
- UI Reusable components like `LzButton`, `LzLink` and `LzContainer` can be found in [UI-Components](https://github.com/LazerPay-Finance/Lazerpay-documentation-v2/tree/main/components/UI). Use these components when working on any issue. You're welcome to create new UI reusable components in the same project folder. Please make sure your new resuable components follow the same naming convention as the existing components.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) helps you to build any design, directly in your markup. We implement this css framework in our components, so knowledge of Tailwind is required. Please go through the [Typography-scss-file](https://github.com/LazerPay-Finance/Lazerpay-documentation-v2/blob/main/styles/typography.scss) to understand how to apply the existing typography in our design pattern. Also, see [Tailwind-config](https://github.com/LazerPay-Finance/Lazerpay-documentation-v2/blob/main/tailwind.config.js) for the list of our colors, shadows, font sizes, etc. Check out [Quicklinks](https://github.com/LazerPay-Finance/Lazerpay-documentation-v2/blob/main/components/QuickLinks/index.tsx) for a sample of how these are implemented.

### Editing an existing docs page
- Make your changes to the neccessary files, create your PR following the issue guideline

### Adding a new docs page to an existing sidebar
- The sidebar is quite easy to use. After creating your page, update the `sidebar.config.ts` file to include your new route/page if it's not already there. Each sidebar option has a nested structure, so if you are working on a nested link under a particular sidebar item, add that page route in the `items` array of the sidebar config.
