# Verify Payments

Transactions are being verified using the Verify Payments endpoint from your server using your transaction reference or with the address property whose value is the payment address returned from the <a href="#">initialise payment</a> function.

## Verify Payment API

To verify transactions using the Lazerpay endpoint, you will make a <code>get</code> request to verify transaction endpoint from your server using your transaction reference or with the address property.

Here’s a code sample for verifying transactions.

<LzTable 
  reverse
  head={['Parameter name', 'Type', 'Description']}
  body={[
    ['<strong>Path</strong>', '', ''],
    ['address_or_reference', '<code>String</code>', 'The transaction <code>Address</code> or <code>reference</code> you want to fetch'],
    ['<strong>Header</strong>', '', ''],
    ['*', '<code>String</code>', 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'],
  ]}
  />
  
<CodeBlock 
  responseTheme="red" 
  responseTitle="Response" 
  data={{type: 'request', item: {method: "GET", requestData: {
    name: ['cURL', 'Javascript'], 
    snippet: ['verifyPaymentGetCURL', 'verifyPaymentGetJs'], 
    lang: ['curl', 'js']
  }, 
  responseData: {
    name: ['200: OK', '404: Not Found'], 
    snippet: ['verifyPaymentGetResponse200', 'verifyPaymentGetResponse404'], 
    lang: ['json', 'json'] }} 
    }} 
  />

#### Important Note from the verification response
1. The <code>actualAmount</code> key is the amount that you intended to charge the customer in crypto.
2. The <code>amountPaid</code> key is the crypto amount that is being paid to the merchant. It is usually in the coins that we support..
3. The <code>amountPaidFirst</code> is the fiat value of the crypto amount beinf paid to the merchant.
4. The <code>fiatAmount</code> is the fiat value of the amount that you intended to charge the customer. This is usually in the merchant’s local currency.

<Alert>The <code>amountReceivedFiat</code> and <code>amountReceived</code> values is the amountPaidFiat plus Lazerpay fees and the AmountPaid plus Lazerpay fees respectively</Alert>

## From Official JS SDK
With the JS SDK, you have access to the confirmPayment object which is used to verify any payment in the Lazerpay platform.

<CodeBlock 
  responseTheme="red" 
  responseTitle="JSON" 
  data={{type: 'request', item: { requestData: {
    name: ['Node'], 
    snippet: ['verifyPaymentNodeSDK'], 
    lang: ['js']
  }, 
  responseData: {
    name: ['200: OK', '401: Unauthorized'], 
    snippet: ['customerInfoReq201', 'customerInfoReq401'], 
    lang: ['json', 'json']}} 
    }} 
  />

<Alert status="warning">If you offer digital value like airtime, wallet top-up, digital credit, etc, always confirm that you have not already processed the value for that transaction to avoid double fulfillments, especially, if you also use webhooks.</Alert>
